It's one of _those_ days.

Yesterday I was on top of the world, I did a couple of bite sized chunks of work and learnt a few small things. Bouyed by my success I dove headlong into tweaking my new personal site tonight. Only to be left feeling a bit meh. I feel like I have too much to get done that I'm not structuring my learning in any solid way – I'm just flapping about and half assing it.

Yesterday I felt like I could tackle anything and win. Today I feel stupid and am questioning my ability to learn anything.

What have I learnt from this?

I have learnt that there are good days and there are bad days. And, you need to compartmentalise the things you need to do, and learn, in order to acheive what it is you want to do. Development by Googling is a thing, and I'm giving it my best. But the amount of information is overwhelming and the paths that you take (that distract you from your goal) are many.

My mottos from tonight onwards:

* *Focus* is something I need to acquire.
* I must break down a problem into bite sized pieces.
* I must solve it one little step at a time.
* I must be strong and understand that setbacks are part of learning.

Like the wise Jake the Dog says "Dude, suckin' at something is the first step towards being sorta good at something".
