For ever I've been thinking, I need to write a blog. Honestly, I think that if I can learn to talk about what I'm learning then it will help cement things in my mind a little better.

Truthfully though, I've been muddling through this project with no idea what's going on. Initially, Jekyll seems pretty simple. To start your project you'll need to install a few things, you'll need Ruby, you'll need to install the Jekyll gem and you'll need true grit.

I have never really worked on anything IRL. So, this is tough, I've learnt that:
1. Css makes me cry - but I love doing it.
2. Ruby (erb) makes me cry even harder - but it's nice to look at.

I finally managed to rip out some of the things I don't need and done some _very_ basic styling that is within the limits of my understanding â€“ which I should add is pretty shit and non-existant. And now, I have no idea how I got my last website on the internet, it was too long ago and I've forgotten :(
